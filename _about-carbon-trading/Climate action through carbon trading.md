##### Cooperative mechanism under the Paris Agreement

Under the Paris Agreement, all countries must communicate their N~n~ationally D~d~etermined C~c~ontributions (NDCs) and set climate targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreementâ€™s climate goal.

**Article 6** of the Paris Agreement allows countries to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their NDCs. This development opened the door to higher ambition in climate mitigation and adaptation actions, while promoting sustainable development and environmental integrity. NDCs can be pursued through a market-based mechanism (Article 6.2, Article 6.4) and a non-market-based mechanism (Article 6.8). Our Minister of Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, co-facilitated the conclusion of the Article 6 rulebook at COP-26 in December 2021.

**Article 6.2 provides the decentralized framework for bilateral or plurilateral cooperation between countries, through market-based mechanism of carbon trading**. Countries will trade Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) on a voluntary basis to jointly achieve their NDCs. Corresponding adjustments will be made to ensure no double counting of emissions reductions and removals by countries.

To bolster the robustness of Article 6.2 cooperation, safeguards will have to be put in place to ensure environmental integrity and transparency. The high environmental integrity principles are as follows:
