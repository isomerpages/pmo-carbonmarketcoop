**Growing carbon markets presents Singapore with emerging green growth opportunities.**

Singapore aspires to develop into a carbon services and trading hub by tapping on its thriving ecosystem and proximity to Southeast Asia, one of the largest carbon credit sources. Based on a [study](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/singapore-is-well-positioned-to-become-a-carbon-services-and-trading-hub-for-southeast-asia-and-the-asia-pacific.html) commissioned by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG), it is estimated that this could create a projected gross value added (GVA) of US$1.8-5.6 billion.

Setting up bilateral cooperation mechanisms with host countries will unlock more green growth opportunities for our carbon services and trading ecosystem beyond Southeast Asia.Â  These opportunities include carbon credit project financing and development, sustainable financing product structuring, and market intermediaries.
