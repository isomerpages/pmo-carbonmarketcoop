_Carbon credits,_ also known as _carbon offsets,_ refer to carbon emissions reductions, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Carbon credits can be generated through projects which take in carbon from the atmosphere (e.g. reforestation), or reduce the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere (e.g. renewable energy projects). *Carbon trading* is a market-based mechanism which enables the buying, selling, transfer, and exchange of carbon credits. *Illustrative process of carbon credits generation and carbon trading:*

To ensure these carbon credits can truly advance global climate action and ambition, they need to meet a set of environmental integrity principles, which are explained in the graphic below.

According to the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, only **correspondingly adjusted carbon credits** can be used for a countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other international mitigation purposes, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). These carbon credits that have been correspondingly adjusted are referred to as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).


**Corresponding adjustments** refers to the transfer of underlying emissions reductions across countries’ greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. For example, when Country X buys 1MtCO2e of carbon credits from Country Y, Country Y has to add 1MtCO2e to its GHG inventory while Country X will reduce 1MtCO2e in its GHG inventory.
