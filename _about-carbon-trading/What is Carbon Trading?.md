#### Definitions
* _Carbon trading_ is the exchange of carbon credits on a carbon market.
* _Carbon markets_ are the trading systems used to buy or sell carbon credits.
* _Carbon credits_ are tradable commodities which represent _verified_ carbon offsets.
* _Carbon offsets_ refer to carbon emissions reductions, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e).
	* Carbon offsets are generated through projects such as forest protection, wind, or solar installations which take in carbon from the atmosphere.
	* In the Paris Agreement, carbon offsets are referred to as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes, or “ITMOs”.
	* There is a limited crediting period during which carbon offsets generated from a project are eligible for issuance as verified carbon offsets.

### Benefits of carbon trading

One of the main premises of Article 6 is that participating in carbon trading is beneficial for host countries.

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carbon trading implements mitigation activities which are **additional**, meaning they would not otherwise happen.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carbon trading provides significant **green growth opportunities** in the private sector.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carbon trading allows the advancement and realization of climate ambitions more **cost effectively**.

**Environmental integrity** – Carbon offsets are only verified if they are real, independently verified, permanent, additional, measurable, impose no net harm, avoid leakage, come from a strong governance and MRV system, and do not get double counted.

Implementing carbon credit projects provides co-benefits and advances sustainable development goals of the Host countries. For instance:

Nature-based carbon trading projects, such as forest restoration/re-forestation, contribute towards biodiversity protection, improve rural livelihoods, and increase carbon sequestration. Solar projects can ensure greater energy security, improved health and wellbeing, enhance the air quality and promote economic growth. Electric buses which replace diesel-powered buses can create green jobs, improve energy security, and significantly lighten air and noise pollution.
