_Carbon credits,_ also known as _carbon offsets,_ refer to carbon emissions reductions, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Carbon offsets can be generated through projects such as forest protection, wind, or solar installations, which take in carbon from the atmosphere.

A flowchart on he full process of carbon trading can be found below.

Carbon credits must also meet these **environmental integrity principles**:

According to the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, only **correspondingly adjusted carbon credits** can be used for a countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other international mitigation purposes, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). These carbon credits that have been correspondingly adjusted are referred to as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).

**Corresponding adjustments** refers to the transfer of underlying emissions reductions across countries’ greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. For example, when Country X buys 1MtCO2e of carbon credits from Country Y, Country Y has to add 1MtCO2e to its GHG inventory while Country X will reduce 1MtCO2e in its GHG inventory.
