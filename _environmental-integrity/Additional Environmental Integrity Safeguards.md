<p>Please note the following requirements for the following specific project
types:</p>
<p><strong><u>Renewable Energy Projects</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Only carbon credits from the following renewable energy projects will
be allowed:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Projects that use offshore wind technology, or waste-to-energy technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are linked with energy storage systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects outside of (1) and (2), but come from (i) Least Developed Countries
(LDC), (ii) micro-grids that are not linked to national grids, or (iii)
lower middle income countries with less than 5% of the said renewable technology
deployed in national grid at the point of registration&nbsp;or renewal</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*Renewable energy projects refer to projects that (i) generate and deliver
energy services (e.g. mechanical, work, electricity, heat) from non-fossil
fuel and renewable energy sources, or (ii) comprise of renewable energy
generation units (e.g. solar PV, tidal/wave, wind, hydro, geothermal, waste-to-energy,
renewable biomass) that are supplying energy or electricity.</p>
<p>** Definition of LDC is based on United Nations’ definition; Definition
of lower middle income countries is based on World Bank’s definition&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Forestry Conservation (i.e., REDD+)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>All forestry projects are required to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use nested baseline or be part of a jurisdictional programme to address
concerns over leakage and non-additionality due to policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not use baseline that incorporates High Forest-Low Deforestation-related
incentive factor</p>
</li>
</ul>
