<h4>Please note the following requirements for the following specific project types:</h4>
<p><strong><u>Renewable Energy Projects</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Only carbon credits from the following renewable energy projects will
be allowed:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Projects that use offshore wind technology, or waste-to-energy technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are linked with energy storage systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects outside of (1) and (2), but come from (i) Least Developed Countries
(LDC), (ii) micro-grids that are not linked to national grids, or (iii)
lower middle income countries with less than 5% of the said renewable technology
deployed in national grid at the point of registration&nbsp;or renewal</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*Renewable energy projects refer to projects that (i) generate and deliver
energy services (e.g. mechanical, work, electricity, heat) from non-fossil
fuel and renewable energy sources, or (ii) comprise of renewable energy
generation units (e.g. solar PV, tidal/wave, wind, hydro, geothermal, waste-to-energy,
renewable biomass) that are supplying energy or electricity.</p>
<p>** Definition of LDC is based on United Nations’ definition; Definition
of lower middle income countries is based on World Bank’s definition&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Forestry Conservation (i.e., REDD+)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>All forestry projects are required to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use nested baseline or be part of a jurisdictional programme to address
concerns over leakage and non-additionality due to policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not use baseline that incorporates High Forest-Low Deforestation-related
incentive factor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>In addition, please note the following requirements for VM0047 and VM0048.</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For the reporting of reversals, all projects must be part of an independent
monitoring mechanism (a) or (b) or be validated with data from an independent
source (c):</p>
<p>(a) Projects under a jurisdictional proponent of a public-private partnership
(e.g. Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ or JNR);</p>
<p>(b) Verra’s programme-level system (e.g. Long-Term Monitoring system)
when it becomes operational in 2026; or</p>
<p>(c) Verification against available resources on deforestation/reversals
(e.g. national inventories/Global Forest Watch)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project developers shall conduct an additionality re-assessment at every
credit issuance tranche if more than 5 years have elapsed after the first
additionality test. For VM0047, this will apply as a financial additionality
re-assessment for projects generating alternative revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[For VM0047] Project start date should be within 5 years of validation
to show criticality of carbon revenue and additionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[For VM0047] Credits generated from project to apply the ABACUS label,
which requires projects to effectively maintain or enhance agricultural
production in the project area and surrounding landscape to prevent leakage,
amongst other safeguards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[For VM0048] To timely identify crediting and leakage risks in between
map updates by Verra, project developers shall perform an ex-post analysis
of the baseline at every credit issuance tranche.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Project developers can provide justifications if they are unable to meet
the above safeguards.</p>
