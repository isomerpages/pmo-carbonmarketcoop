Only carbon credits from the following renewable energy projects will be allowed:

1. Projects that use offshore wind technology, or waste-to-energy technology
2. Projects that are linked with energy storage systems
3. Projects outside of (1) and (2), but come from (i) Least Developed Countries (LDC),
(ii) micro-grids that are not linked to national grids, or (iii) lower middle income
countries with less than 5% of the said renewable technology deployed in national
grid at the point of registration&nbsp;or renewal

**Renewable energy projects refers to projects that (i) generate and deliver energy services
(e.g. mechanical, work, electricity, heat) from non-fossil fuel and renewable energy sources,
or (ii) comprise of renewable energy generation units (e.g. solar PV, tidal/wave, wind, hydro,
geothermal, waste-to-energy, renewable biomass) that are supplying energy or electricity.*

**Definition of LDC is based on United Nations’ definition; Definition of lower middle
income countries is based on World Bank’s definition*


All forestry conservation projects (i.e. REDD+) must:




| Project type | Additional safeguard(s) |
| -------- | -------- |
| Forestry conservation (ie. REDD+) | Use nested baseline or be part of a jurisdictional programme to address concerns over leakage and non-additionality due to policy <br>  Not use baseline that incorporates HFLD-related incentive factor|
