### The Eligibility Criteria 

**Carbon credit generation**

These ensure that the carbon credits generated are environmentally robust.  

* Carbon credits must represent emissions reductions or removals that are **additional**, meaning those which exceed any reductions that are already
mandated or would otherwise occur in a conservative, business as usual scenario. The tests for additionality are robust and publicly disclosed. 

* Carbon credits must be issued against a **realistic**, defensible, and conservative baseline estimation of “business as usual” emissions.
* Carbon credits must be calculated in a conservative and transparent method. More specifically, they must be based on accurate measurements and quantification methods/protocols, verified by independent third-party verification entities, and verification should be conducted ex-post the project
emissions. Ex-ante issued credits are not eligible.  
* Carbon credits must have a clear chain of custody within the International Offset Programme. 
* Carbon credits must represent emissions reductions that are irreversible and therefore permanent. 
 Carbon credits should be generated from projects that do not cause emissions to materially increase elsewhere (this is known as **leakage**) and
must have measures in place to assess and mitigate incidences of material leakage. 
* Carbon credits must represent emissions reductions that “do no net harm”, meaning, they comply with local social and environmental
safeguards. 

 
**Programme governance and operation **

These ensure that International Offset Programmes are robustly governed and generate carbon credits of high environmental integrity. 
* IOPs are required to put in place **clear methodologies**, protocols, and their development processes. 
* IOPs must **publicly disclose eligibility criteria** for each type of offset activity – including sectors, project types, geographic locations. 
* IOPs must put in place carbon credit issuance and retirement procedures. These track how carbon credits are issued, retired, cancelled,
discounted, and the length of crediting and whether that period is renewable. 
* IOPs must have **carbon credit identification** and tracking procedures, which ensure that: 1) units are tracked, 2) units are identified through serial
numbers, 3) the registry has robust security provisions in place, 4) units have clearly identified owners or holders, 5) stipulations as to whether they are
linked to other registries, 6) whether and which international data exchange standards the registry conforms with.   
* IOPs must define and ensure the attributes and property aspects of a carbon credit.  
* IOPs must put in place **validation and verification standards** and procedures, as well as requirements and procedures for the accreditation of
validators and verifiers.  
* IOPs must publicly disclose who is responsible for their administration and how decisions are made. 
* IOPs must publicly disclose a) what information is captured and made available to different stakeholders,  
* IOPs must only count carbon credits once towards a mitigation obligation to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming.  

 
*CARBON PRICING ACT*

Singapore enacted the Carbon Pricing Act (Rev Ed 2020) to put in place regulations governing the reporting and payment of carbon taxes.
