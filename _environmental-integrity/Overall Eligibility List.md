<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eligibility List sets out the requirements that international carbon credits (ICCs) must meet to be accepted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) for carbon tax-liable companies in Singapore to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 1 Jan 2024.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ICCs must each represent one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reductions or removals measured in tCO2e, where —</p><p>2a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ICCs are generated from a project or programme that meets the specific requirements in Annex A (where Annex A is applicable);</p><p>2b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the project or programme is carried out in a country specified in the first column in Annex B;</p><p>2c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ICCs are issued under a carbon crediting programme in the second column of Annex B, opposite that country; and</p><p>2d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the certified greenhouse gas emissions reductions or removals represented by the ICCs are calculated using a methodology in the third column of Annex B, opposite that carbon crediting programme.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eligibility List may be reviewed and updated from time to time. In particular, it will be reviewed annually to maintain relevance and uphold high environmental integrity standards based on the latest science and evidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>ANNEX A</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Applicable for 2024 Emissions Year onwards, last updated 19 Dec 2023&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Specific Requirements for Project Types</u></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For renewable energy projects &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, only ICCs from the following projects are eligible:&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Projects that use offshore wind technology, or waste-to-energy technology;
