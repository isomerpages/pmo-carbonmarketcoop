<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Eligibility List sets out the requirements that international carbon
credits (ICCs) must meet to be accepted by the National Environment Agency
(NEA) for carbon tax-liable companies in Singapore to offset up to 5% of
their taxable emissions from 1 Jan 2024.</p>
<p></p>

<li>
<p>The ICCs must each represent one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reductions
or removals measured in tCO2e, where —</p>

<li>
<p>The ICCs are generated from a project or programme that meets the specific
requirements in Annex A (where Annex A is applicable);</p>

<p>the project or programme is carried out in a country specified in the
first column in Annex B;</p>

<p>the ICCs are issued under a carbon crediting programme in the second column
of Annex B, opposite that country; and</p>

<h3><strong>ANNEX A</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Applicable for 2024 Emissions Year onwards, last updated 8 Feb 2024</p>
<h4><strong><u>Specific Requirements for Project Types</u></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>For renewable energy projects<sup>1</sup>, only ICCs from the following projects are eligible:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Projects that use offshore wind technology, or waste-to-energy technology;
or&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are linked with energy storage systems; or&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects outside of (1) and (2) that come from (i) Least Developed Countries
(LDC)2, (ii) micro-grids that are not linked to national grids, or (iii)
lower middle income countries2 with less than 5% of the said renewable
technology deployed in their national grid at the point of registration
or renewal.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em><sup>1  </sup>Renewable energy projects refer to projects that (i) generate and deliver energy services (e.g. mechanical, work, electricity, heat) from non-fossil fuel and renewable energy sources, or (ii) comprise of renewable energy generation units (e.g. solar PV, tidal/wave, wind, hydro, geothermal, waste-to-energy, renewable biomass) that are supplying energy or electricity.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><em><sup>2  </sup>Definition of LDC is based on <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldcs-at-a-glance.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations’ definition</a>; Definition of lower middle income countries is based on <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=XN" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Bank’s definition</a>.&nbsp;</em>

<p><strong>For High Forest cover, Low Deforestation (HFLD)<sup>3</sup> countries,</strong> 
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD/REDD+)
projects or programmes are not eligible.&nbsp;</p>
