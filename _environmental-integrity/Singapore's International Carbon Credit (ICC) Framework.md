<h4><strong>International Carbon Credits (ICCs) used must comply with Singapore’s Eligibility Criteria</strong></h4>
<p>Under the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Act 2022 (CPA), carbon tax-liable
facilities can use eligible ICCs to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions
from 1 Jan 2024. ICCs must meet Singapore’s Eligibility Criteria.</p>
<p>The Eligibility Criteria for ICCs is prescribed in the Carbon Pricing
(Carbon Tax and Carbon Credits Registry) (Amendment) Regulations 2023,
and is summarised in the table below.</p>
