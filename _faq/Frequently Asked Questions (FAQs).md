<p>The <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/environmental-integrity/overall-eligibility-list/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eligibility List</a>&nbsp;shows
the carbon crediting programmes and methodologies that adhere to the
<a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/environmental-integrity/eligibility-criteria/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eligibility Criteria</a>. The National Environment Agency of Singapore
(NEA) will review and update the Eligibility List from time to time. In
particular, the Eligibility List will be reviewed annually to maintain
relevance and uphold high environmental integrity standards, based on the
latest science and evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEA signed Memoranda of Understanding with carbon crediting programmes,
&nbsp;to leverage their capabilities in ensuring that carbon credits issued
under their registries are robustly validated, verified, issued, and retired.
This will facilitate Singapore-based companies in exercising the option
to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per
cent of their taxable emissions from 1 Jan 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carbon crediting programmes and methodologies that are eligible may
be different for each host country, as host countries also have their own
criteria. The Eligibility List for each host country would be agreed under
the respective Implementation Agreement, which sets out the framework and
processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits
aligned with Article 6.</p>
