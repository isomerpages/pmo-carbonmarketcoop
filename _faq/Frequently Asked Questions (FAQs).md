<summary><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the Eligibility List of programmes and methodologies determined?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/environmental-integrity/overall-eligibility-list/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eligibility List</a>&nbsp;shows
the carbon crediting programmes and methodologies that adhere to the
<a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/environmental-integrity/eligibility-criteria/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eligibility Criteria</a>. The National Environment Agency of Singapore
(NEA) will review and update the Eligibility List from time to time. In
particular, the Eligibility List will be reviewed annually to maintain
relevance and uphold high environmental integrity standards, based on the
latest science and evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEA signed Memoranda of Understanding with carbon crediting programmes,
&nbsp;to leverage their capabilities in ensuring that carbon credits issued
under their registries are robustly validated, verified, issued, and retired.
This will facilitate Singapore-based companies in exercising the option
to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per
cent of their taxable emissions from 1 Jan 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carbon crediting programmes and methodologies that are eligible may
be different for each host country, as host countries also have their own
criteria. The Eligibility List for each host country would be agreed under
the respective Implementation Agreement, which sets out the framework and
processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits
aligned with Article 6.</p>

<summary><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can taxable facilities check if the carbon credits generated from a project can be used for carbon tax offset?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The carbon credits must be authorised for corresponding adjustment and
fall under the Eligibility List to be used for carbon tax offset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorised projects that may generate eligibility carbon credits will
be listed on a <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/project-register/overall-register/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">project register</a> on
Singapore’s Carbon Markets Cooperation website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the carbon tax administration process, carbon tax-liable companies
will also submit the Notice of ICC Use to the National Environment Agency
of Singapore for confirmation on the eligibility of ICCs the company has
identified before using them to offset their taxable emissions.</p>

<summary><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the authorisation process for a carbon credit project?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The authorisation process is detailed under the Overview and Processes
section of each country’s Implementation Agreement page. This may differ
across Implementation Agreements, as they are agreed upon by both countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, to seek authorisation under the respective Implementation Agreement,
project applicants should submit the required forms and documents. Singapore
and the host country will assess the project to ensure that they meet the
environmental integrity criteria of the respective country, and other domestic
requirements.</p>

for authorisation, provided they meet both countries’ applicable domestic

<summary><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will Implementation Agreements with other countries be signed?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore is working closely with partner countries to sign and effect
the Implementation Agreements. However, the timeline varies as there are
differences among partner countries in the infrastructure, frameworks and
processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore will continue to actively engage partner countries to sign and
effect Implementation Agreements on carbon credit collaboration.</p>
