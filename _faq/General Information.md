<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can a carbon tax-liable facility
source for eligible International Carbon Credits (ICCs)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tax-liable facilities can work with project developers or third-party
service provider to either source eligible ICCs from existing projects
or develop new ones.</p>

<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where can I find the list of projects
that have been authorised to generate Internationally Transferred Mitigation
Outcomes?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Companies may refer to the Implementation Agreement (IA) <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/project-register/overall-register/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">project register</a>,

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. To comply with Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, carbon credits

<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When can carbon tax-liable companies
expect to buy ICCs?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore has signed Implementation Agreements (IAs) with Bhutan, Chile,
Ghana, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Rwanda and Paraguay on Article 6 carbon
