<summary>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the difference between
International Carbon Credits (ICCs) and Internationally Transferred Mitigation
Outcomes?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>International Carbon Credits (ICCs) are ITMOs (Internationally Transferred
Mitigation Outcomes) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that meet the
requirements set out under Singapore’s ICC framework. Refer to <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/latest-news/eligibility-criteria-for-internationalcarboncredits" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a> for
more information on the ICC framework.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can a carbon tax-liable facility
source for eligible International Carbon Credits (ICCs)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tax-liable facilities can work with project developers or third-party
service provider to either source eligible ICCs from existing projects
or develop new ones.</p>
<p>Companies that wish to develop their own ICC projects may refer to information
the processes under each Implementation Agreement and participation criteria
to ensure that the ICCs generated from their projects will be accepted
under the carbon tax.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where can I find the list of projects
that have been authorised to generate Internationally Transferred Mitigation
Outcomes?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Companies may refer to the Implementation Agreement (IA) <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/project-register/overall-register/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">project register</a>,
which will list the projects that have been authorised under the IA for
corresponding adjustments.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can carbon tax-liable companies
purchase carbon credits from countries other than those countries that
Singapore have signed Implementation Agreements with?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. To comply with Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, carbon credits
from projects hosted in countries without an implementation agreement are
not allowed to be used to offset carbon-tax liability under Singapore’s
ICC Framework.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When can carbon tax-liable companies
expect to buy ICCs?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Under the ICC Framework, carbon tax-liable companies may use eligible
ICCs to offset up to 5% of their carbon tax liabilities annually.</p>
<p>Singapore has signed legally binding Implementation Agreements (IAs) with
seven countries – Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Bhutan, Peru, Chile, Rwanda,
Paraguay. We are actively working with our counterparts to further our
collaboration and operationalise these partnerships and to generate eligible
ICCs from projects authorised under these IAs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there may be a constrained supply of ICCs for emissions
year 2024. In light of this, taxable facilities will be allowed to roll
over their unutilised ICC offset limit, of up to 5% of taxable emissions
in 2024, to emissions year 2025. This will allow more time for projects
to be authorised under Singapore’s Article 6 IAs, and for these projects
to generate eligible ICCs.</p>
