<p><strong>Eligibility List</strong>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register a project using
a methodology that is not on the Eligibility List (EL)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Projects must use carbon credit programmes and methodologies listed
on the Eligibility List at the point of submission. Please refer to the
Eligibility List under each Implementation Agreement (IA), which is jointly
agreed between Singapore and the host country. One example is the Singapore-Ghana
Eligibility List, which can be found <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/eligibility-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are carbon crediting programmes
and methodologies selected for inclusion in the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore takes reference from reputable international standards such
as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA) in the development of the Eligibility List.</p>
<p>Please note that the Eligiblity List differs by host country as accepted
methodologies would have to fulfill the requirements of the host countries.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Singapore take the approach
of only accepting the methodologies on the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This approach allows Singapore to tap into Carbon Crediting Programmes’
(CCPs) capabilities in ensuring that ICCs are robustly validated, verified,
issued and retired. It also enables faster time-to-market given that the
methodologies are already published, and streamlines the registration process
given industry’s familiarity.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often is the Eligibility List
updated?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List is reviewed regularly to maintain relevance and uphold
the required environmental integrity standards.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can project applicants submit methodologies
to be included in the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List sets out the carbon credit programmes and methodologies
that meet Singapore’s and our host country’s eligibility criteria. For
any feedback on the Eligibility List, project applicants may wish to write
to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICC_Article_6@nea.gov.sg</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are carbon credits used in Singapore's
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) also restricted to the whitelisted methodologies
on NEA's Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are no restrictions on credits that can be bought or sold in Singapore’s
Voluntary Carbon Market.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For agreements without an Eligibility
List, when will it be made available?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List is bilaterally agreed upon between Singapore and
the host country. The Eligibility List will be published online when ready.</p>

<p><strong>Authorisation</strong>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register projects in countries
where Singapore does not have an Implementation Agreement with?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Only carbon credits generated in countries where Singapore has an IA can
be authorised and transferred as Internationally Transferable Mitigation
Outcomes (ITMOs), in compliance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Singapore is actively engaging partner countries on Implementation Agreements
on carbon credit collaboration.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I request for authorisation
for a project that has been implemented?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, existing projects that have already been implemented may still be
considered for authorisation, provided they meet both countries’ applicable
domestic laws, regulations and administrative framework.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Implementation Agreement
(IA) authorisation process, are project applicants required to submit a
Project Design Document (PDD) to the Singapore Government before registering
the project with a Carbon Crediting Programme (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes. Depending on the eligibility criteria agreed with each host country,
it is possible for project applicants to submit their PDD to carbon crediting
programmes prior to initiating the application under the IA process. These
projects are still required to go through all stages of the application
process and comply with all other requirements. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Right of First Offer (ROFO) and Request for Proposal (RFP)</strong>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do I need to
submit an offer to Singapore under the Right of First Offer (ROFO) requirement?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>You should submit a binding offer to Singapore Government at the point
of validated Project Design Document (PDD) to the Singapore Government
under the Implementation Agreement (IA) authorisation process. The specific
stage of the authorisation process may differ, depending on the IA. For
example, this will be Stage C in the Singapore-Ghana IA authorisation process,
and Stage B in the Singapore-Rwanda IA authorisation process.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Singapore
Government be setting a fixed price for the Right of First Offer requirement
(ROFO), or can the project developer determine the price?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Singapore Government will not pre-determine the price of ITMOs under
the Right of First Offer (ROFO) requirement.</p>

<summary>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I sell my Internationally
Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) to other buyers, if the Singapore
Government declines to purchase them under the Right Of First Offer (ROFO)
requirement?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, if the Singapore Government declines to purchase the ITMOs offered
under ROFO, you may sell them to other buyers. Please note that the sale
of the ITMO is still subject to the <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/implementation-agreements/participation-criteria/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eligible Entity</a> requirement.</p>

<p>ITMOs authorised under Singapore’s IAs must first be sold or transferred
to <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/participation-criteria/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eligible Entities</a>.
Once the ITMOs have met the Eligible Entity criteria, they can be sold
domestically or internationally. Besides the Singapore Government, other

sectoral compliance schemes such as CORSIA.</p>
