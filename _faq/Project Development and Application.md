<p><strong>Eligibility List</strong>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register a project using
a methodology that is not on the Eligibility List (EL)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Projects must use carbon credit programmes and methodologies listed
on the eligibility list at the point of submission. Please refer to the
Eligibility List of methodologies under each Implementation Agreement (IA),
which is jointly agreed between Singapore and the host country. One example
is the Singapore-Ghana Eligibility List, which can be found <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/eligibility-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are carbon crediting programmes
and methodologies selected for inclusion in the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore takes reference from reputable international standards such
as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA) in the development of the Eligibility List.</p>
<p>Please note that the EL differs by host country as accepted methodologies
would have to fulfill the requirements of the host countries.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Singapore take the approach
of only accepting the methodologies on the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This approach allows Singapore to tap into Carbon Crediting Programmes’
(CCPs) capabilities in ensuring that ICCs are robustly validated, verified,
issued and retired. It also enables faster time-to-market given that the
methodologies are already published, and streamlines the registration process
given industry’s familiarity.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often is the Eligibility List
updated?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List is reviewed regularly to maintain relevance and uphold
the required environmental integrity standards.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I request for authorisation
for a project that has been implemented?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, existing projects that have already been implemented may still be
considered for authorisation, provided they meet both countries’ applicable
domestic laws, regulations and administrative framework.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register projects in countries
where Singapore does not have an Implementation Agreement with?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Only carbon credits generated in countries where Singapore has an Implementation
Agreement can be authorised and transferred as Internationally Transferable
Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), in compliance with Article 6 of the Paris
Agreement.</p>
<p>Singapore is actively engaging partner countries to sign and effect Implementation
Agreements on carbon credit collaboration.</p>
