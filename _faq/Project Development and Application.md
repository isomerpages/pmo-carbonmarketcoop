<summary>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register a project using
a methodology that is not on the Eligibility List (EL)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Projects must use carbon credit programmes and methodologies listed
on the eligibility list at the point of submission.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are carbon crediting programmes
and methodologies selected for inclusion in the EL?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore takes reference from reputable international standards such
as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA) in the development of the EL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please note that the EL differs by host country as accepted methodologies
would have to fulfill the requirements of the host countries.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Singapore take the approach
of only accepting a set of pre-approved/whitelisted methodologies?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This approach allows Singapore to tap on Carbon Crediting Programmes’
(CCPs) capabilities in ensuring that ICCs are robustly validated, verified,
issued and retired. It also enables faster time-to-market given that the
methodologies are already published, and streamlines the registration process
given industry’s familiarity.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often is the EL updated?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The EL is reviewed regularly to maintain relevance and uphold the required
environmental integrity standards. Updates will be made to the relevant
pages whenever available.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I request for authorisation
for a project that has been implemented?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, existing projects that have already been implemented may still be
considered for authorisation, provided they meet both countries’ applicable
domestic laws, regulations and administrative framework.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register projects in countries
where Singapore does not have an Implementation Agreement with?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Only carbon credits generated in countries where Singapore has an Implementation
Agreement can be authorised and transferred as Internationally Transferable
Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), in compliance with Article 6 of the Paris
Agreement.</p>
<p>Singapore is actively engaging partner countries to sign and effect Implementation
Agreements on carbon credit collaboration.</p>
