<p><strong>Eligibility List</strong>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I register a project using
a methodology that is not on the Eligibility List (EL)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Projects must use carbon credit programmes and methodologies listed
on the eligibility list at the point of submission. Please refer to the
Eligibility List of methodologies under each Implementation Agreement (IA),
which is jointly agreed between Singapore and the host country. One example
is the Singapore-Ghana Eligibility List, which can be found <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/eligibility-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are carbon crediting programmes
and methodologies selected for inclusion in the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore takes reference from reputable international standards such
as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA) in the development of the Eligibility List.</p>
<p>Please note that the EL differs by host country as accepted methodologies
would have to fulfill the requirements of the host countries.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Singapore take the approach
of only accepting the methodologies on the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This approach allows Singapore to tap into Carbon Crediting Programmes’
(CCPs) capabilities in ensuring that ICCs are robustly validated, verified,
issued and retired. It also enables faster time-to-market given that the
methodologies are already published, and streamlines the registration process
given industry’s familiarity.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often is the Eligibility List
updated?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List is reviewed regularly to maintain relevance and uphold
the required environmental integrity standards.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can project applicants submit methodologies
to be included in the Eligibility List?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Eligibility List sets out the carbon credit programmes and methodologies
that meet Singapore’s and our host country’s eligibility criteria. For
any feedback on the Eligibility List, project applicants may wish to write
to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICC_Article_6@nea.gov.sg</a>.</p>

<summary>Can I request for authorisation for a project that has been implemented?</summary>

considered for authorisation, provided they meet both countries’ applicable
domestic laws, regulations and administrative framework.</p>
