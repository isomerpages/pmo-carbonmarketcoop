<h3>Approved Carbon Crediting Programmes and&nbsp;Methodologies</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Any mitigation project must utilise methodologies approved by either the <strong>Global Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG) or the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Project applicants should check with the respective websites to ensure
that the methodology used for the project is <strong>up to date</strong>.
Otherwise, project applications may not be accepted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programmes and methodologies approved by both Ghana and Singapore
are:</p>

<p>The above list of offset programmes and methodologies meet the eligibility
criteria, environmental integrity, and domestic laws, regulations and administrative
frameworks of both Ghana and Singapore.
<br>
</p>
<p>Though pre-approvals have been granted to the above list of methodologies,
the applicability of these methodologies may be further assessed by both
Ghana and Singapore when project applicant submits for registration. Based
on the further assessment, Singapore or Ghana may refuse to authorise a
mitigation activity in scenarios where its methodology fails to qualify
as a pre-approved methodology under Annex A of the IA. The refusal for
authorisation may be because:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The methodology is not aligned with relevant domestic laws, regulations
and administrative frameworks of respective countries, when a project applicant
submits its application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology has been suspended or placed under formal review by a
relevant offset programme at the point when the project applicant submits
the application for authorisation of a mitigation activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology is not the latest version of a methodology listed in the
Eligibility List.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

by Singapore&nbsp;can be found <a href="https://carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/environmental-integrity/overall-eligibility-list/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
