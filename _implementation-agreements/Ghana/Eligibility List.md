### Approved Carbon Crediting Programmes and Carbon Crediting Methodologies

Any mitigation project must utilise an approved methodology from either the [**Global Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG)**](/https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/gold-standard-previous-gs4gg/) or the [**Verra - Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)**](/https://verra.org/) program.

Project applicants should check with the respective websites to ensure that the
methodology used for the project is up to date. Otherwise, project applications may not
be accepted.


The programmes and methodologies approved by both Ghana and Singapore are:

| Offset Programmes | Methodologies | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Gold standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG)  | All methodologies published before 31 March 2023, except  those under the "Land Use and Forestry &amp; Agriculture" category of GS4GG. |
|Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)| All methodologies published before 31 March 2023, except those that are under the “Sectoral Scope 14” category of VCS and are **not** indicated below: <br> Scenario 2a and 3 of VCS Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) framework <br> VM0012 <br> VM0017 <br> VM0021 <br> VM0022 <br> VM0024 <br> VM0026 (and VMD0040) <br> VM0032 <br> VM0033 <br> VM0036 <br> VM0040 <br> VM0041 <br> VM0042 <br> Where any VCS methodology is used, the project participant will be required to demonstrate the Sustainable Development contributions or co-benefits of the relevant mitigation activity by submitting to the Joint Committee its verification report under the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB Standards), the Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) or another standard recognised by VCS for such purpose. | 

The above list of offset programmes and methodologies meet the eligibility criteria,
environmental integrity, and domestic laws, regulations and administrative frameworks of
both Ghana and Singapore.

Though pre-approvals have been granted to the above list of methodologies, the
applicability of these methodologies may be further assessed by both Ghana and
Singapore when project applicant submits for registration. Based on the further
assessment, Singapore or Ghana may refuse to authorise a mitigation activity in
scenarios where its methodology fails to qualify as a pre-approved methodology under
Annex A. The refusal for authorisation may be because:

1. The methodology is not aligned with relevant domestic laws, regulations and
administrative frameworks of respective countries, when a project applicant
submits its application.
2. The methodology has been suspended or placed under formal review by a
relevant offset programme at the point when the project applicant submits the
application for authorisation of a mitigation activity.
3. The methodology is not the latest version of a methodology listed in Annex A.
