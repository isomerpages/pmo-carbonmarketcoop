### Process Flowchart

A detailed overview of the process to seek Article 6 authorisation of the mitigation activities and the mitigation outcomes, including required documents at each stage, is outlined in the chart below:

*Table outlining stages and submission documents*

##### *Stage A – Feasibility of the proposed mitigation activity*

The project applicant submits an application to Singapore and Ghana’s Joint Committee, using the template which is available for download at the end of this page. The Joint Committee will determine whether their proposed mitigation activity is conceptually feasible and acceptable (e.g. meeting the environmental integrity requirements, eligibility of project types).

After assessment, the Joint Committee will inform the project applicant of the outcome. If the proposed mitigation activity concept is feasible and acceptable, the Joint Committee will forward the first letter of support and letter of intent issued by Singapore and Ghana respectively. These letters may also lay out any conditions that the project applicant should meet in designing the proposed mitigation activity.

If the proposed mitigation activity concept is not feasible or acceptable, the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their proposed mitigation activi

##### _Stage B – Design of the proposed mitigation activity_

The project applicant submits a project design document to the Joint Committee, using the template at the end of this page. Singapore and Ghana’s governments will determine whether the applicant’s design of their proposed mitigation activity is acceptable under the Implementation Agreement, and aligned with the conditions in the earlier issued first letter of support and letter of intent.

After assessment, the Joint Committee will inform the project applicant of the outcome. If the proposed mitigation project design is acceptable, the Joint Committee forward the second letter of support and letter of intent issued by Singapore and Ghana respectively. These letters may also lay out any conditions that the project applicant should meet in designing the mitigation project.

If the proposed mitigation project design is not feasible or acceptable, the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their project design.

##### _Stage C – Authorisation of the proposed mitigation activity_

The project applicant submits an authorisation application and the validation report of the proposed mitigation to the Joint Committee, using the template at the end of this page. The Joint Committee will determine whether their mitigation project is acceptable.

After assessment, the Joint Committee will inform the project applicant of the outcome. If the proposed project is acceptable, the Joint Committee will:

1) forward the letters of authorisation from Singapore and Ghana respectively,

2) enter the mitigation activity into the register,

3) submit the initial report prepared jointly by Singapore and Ghana to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

After the initial report has been accepted by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Joint Committee will &nbsp;issue a Joint Statement of Authorisation to the project applicant, and &nbsp;publish the Joint Statement of Authorisation. The Joint Statement of Authorisation can be found at this .

After this, the project “applicant” becomes a project “participant”. They may then **register** their mitigation activity with the approved International Offset Programme as stated in the letters of authorisation and **inform** the Joint Committee of their registration. They may then begin to implement their project.

If the proposed mitigation project is not authorised, the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their project authorisation application.

##### _Stage D – ITMO Issuance Authorisation_

The Project Participant submits an ITMO issuance application to Singapore and Ghana’s Joint Committee. The Joint Committee sends the application so Singapore and Ghana separately to determine if the ITMO issuance meets their national requirements.

After about 29 working days, the Joint Committee will inform the project participant of the outcome. If the ITMOs are authorised for issuance, Ghana will issue a Letter of Positive Examination and list the ITMOs in its national registry. Corresponding adjustments will also be made, in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

If the proposed mitigation project is not authorised, the applicant will be advised on how to revise their ITMO issuance application.
