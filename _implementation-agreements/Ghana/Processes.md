### Process Flowchart

A detailed overview of the process to seek Article 6 authorisation of the mitigation activities and the mitigation outcomes, including required documents at each stage, is outlined in the chart below:

*Table outlining stages and submission documents*

##### *Stage A – Feasibility of the proposed mitigation activity*

The project applicant submits a **Project Application** to the Joint Committee.
If the proposed mitigation activity concept is accepted by both countries, the Joint
Committee will issue the **Letter of Support** and **Letter of Intent** from Singapore and Ghana
respectively. These letters may specify the conditions that the project applicant should
meet in designing the proposed mitigation activity.
If the proposed mitigation activity concept is not accepted, the project applicant will be
informed, along with any reasons for the non-acceptance (if relevant).

| Required forms | Required documents | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| XXX     | YYY     |

Singapore and Ghana may request for the submission of other relevant documents not
listed above to aid their assessment.

##### _Stage B – Design of the proposed mitigation activity_

The project applicant submits the Project Design Document (PDD) Submission Template to
Joint Committee for assessment by Singapore and Ghana, which will be based on based on
the conditions and requirements in the Implementation Agreement, letter of support and letter of intent.

After assessment, the Joint Committee will inform the project applicant of the PDD
submission outcome.

If the PDD Submission is accepted, Ghana will issue letter of recommendation and
Singapore will reaffirm the earlier issued Letter of Support via an email to the Joint
Committee, which will be forwarded to the project applicant. The PDD submission is
accepted when:
* There is no change in EI requirement that may affect the project; or
* There is a is change in EI requirement after the issuance of the Letter of Support,
and the project applicant submits the PDD within the 1-year assurance period

Please note that Singapore will issue a new Letter of Support if there is a is change in EI
requirement after the issuance of the Letter of Support and the Letter of Support has
passed the 1-year assurance period.

If the PDD Submission is rejected because the project design is not feasible or acceptable,
the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their project design (if relevant).

Singapore and Ghana may request for the submission of other relevant documents not
listed above to aid their assessment.



##### _Stage C – Authorisation of the proposed mitigation activity_

The project applicant submits an authorisation application and the validation report of the
proposed mitigation activity to the Joint Committee.

The Joint Committee will assess the proposed activity and inform the project applicant of
the outcome.

If the proposed mitigation activity is authorised, the Joint Committee will:
1) forward the letters of authorisation from Singapore and Ghana respectively,
2) enter the mitigation activity into the register,
3) submit the initial report prepared jointly by Singapore and Ghana to the UNFCCC
Secretariat.

After the initial report has been accepted by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Joint Committee
will issue a Joint Statement of Authorisation to the project applicant, and publish the Joint
Statement of Authorisation.

After a Joint Statement of Authorisation has been issued, the project “applicant” becomes
a project “participant”. Project participants may then register their mitigation activity with the approved International Offset Programme stated in the letters of authorisation and
inform the Joint Committee of their registration. They may then begin to implement their
project.

If the proposed activity is not authorised, the project applicant will be advised by the Joint
Committee on how to revise their project authorisation application (if relevant).

| Required forms | Required documents | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| XXX     | Joint Statements of Authorisation |

##### _Stage D – ITMO Issuance Authorisation_

The Project Participant submits an ITMO issuance application to Singapore and Ghana’s
Joint Committee.

The Joint Committee sends the application to Singapore and Ghana separately to
determine if the ITMO issuance meets their national requirements. The Joint Committee
will inform the project participant of the outcome after assessment.

If the ITMOs are authorised for issuance, Ghana will issue a Letter of Positive Examination
and list the ITMOs in its national registry. Corresponding adjustments will also be made, in
accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

If the ITMOs are not authorised for issuance, the applicant will be advised on how to
revise their ITMO issuance application (if relevant).

Singapore and Ghana may request for the submission of other relevant documents not
listed above to aid their assessment.


### Approved International Offset Programmes

Any mitigation project must utilize an approved (post 1st Jan 2016) methodology from either the [**Global Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG)**](/https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/gold-standard-previous-gs4gg/) or the [**Verra - Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)**](/https://verra.org/) program.

Please check the respective websites to ensure you are using the most updated version of a methodology. Otherwise, your application may be refused.

The programmes approved by both Ghana and Singapore are:

| Offset Programmes | Methodologies | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Gold standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG)   |All methodologies published after 1 Jan 2016 except those under the "Land Use and Forestry &amp; Agriculture" category of GS4GG. |
|Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)|All methodologies published after 1 Jan 2016 except those that are under the "Sectoral scope 14" category of VCS and are not indicated below: Scenario 2a and 3 of VCS Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) framework <br> VM0012 <br> VM0017 <br> VM0021 <br> VM0022 <br> VM0024 <br> VM0026 <br> VM0032 <br> VM0033 <br> VM0036 <br> VM0040 <br> VM0041 <br> VM0042|
