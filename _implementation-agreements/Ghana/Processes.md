<p>The project applicant submits the completed <u>Mitigation Action Assessment Protocol</u> to

of the PDD submission outcome.</p>

<p>There is no change in EI requirement that may affect the project; or</p>

period</p>

<p>If the PDD Submission is rejected because the project design is not feasible
or acceptable, the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their
project design (if relevant).</p>

<p>The project applicant submits a completed <u>Authorisation Application Form</u> and
the validation report of the proposed mitigation activity to the Joint
Committee. Please note that the submission should be made within the validity
period of the LOS. After the validity period, NEA reserves the right to

will:</p>

respectively; and</p>

<p>The Joint Committee will then issue a <u>Joint Statement of Authorisation</u> to
the project applicant, and publish the Joint Statement of Authorisation.</p>
<p>After a Joint Statement of Authorisation has been issued, the project
“applicant” becomes a project “participant”. Project participants may then <strong>register</strong> their
mitigation activity with the approved International Offset Programme stated
in the letters of authorisation and <strong>inform </strong>the Joint Committee
of their registration. They may then begin to implement their project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the proposed activity is not authorised, the project applicant will
be advised by the Joint Committee on how to revise their project authorisation
application (if relevant).</p>
