### What are Implementation Agreements?

Implementation Agreements (IAs) set out the bilateral framework for the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits (i.e. mitigation outcomes), which cover processes such as project authorisation, reporting, and corresponding adjustments. To authorise mitigation activities and issue ITMOs, a Joint Committee will be formed to serve as an administrative point of contact between private parties, host countries, and Singapore. Private sector players can leverage this framework to develop carbon credit projects that issue ITMOs.
