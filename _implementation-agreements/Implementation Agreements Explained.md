### What are Implementation Agreements?

Implementation Agreements (IAs) are legally binding documents. They establish _bilateral frameworks_ between Singapore and the Host Country to govern and facilitate the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits (i.e. mitigation outcomes), which cover processes such as project authorisation, reporting, and corresponding adjustments. The process of authorisation is different for each country depending on what the eligibility criteria are.

**Joint committee â€“** To authorise mitigation activities and issue ITMOs, a Joint Committee will be formed to serve as an administrative point of contact between private parties, host countries, and Singapore.

Private sector players can leverage this framework to develop carbon credit projects that issue ITMOs.
