The refusal for authorisation may be because:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The methodology is not aligned with relevant domestic laws, regulations and administrative frameworks of respective countries, when a project applicant submits its application.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The methodology has been suspended or placed under formal review by a relevant offset programme at the point when the project applicant submits the application for authorisation of a mitigation activity.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The methodology is not the latest version of a methodology listed in Annex A.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional environmental integrity requirements and safeguards imposed by Singapore&nbsp;can be found <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
