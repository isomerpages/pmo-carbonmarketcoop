<p><em>Stage A – Feasibility of the proposed mitigation activity</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>The project applicant submits a <u>Project Application</u> to the Joint
Committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the proposed mitigation activity concept is accepted by both countries,
the Joint Committee will issue the <u>Letter of Support</u> and <u>Letter of Intent</u> from
Singapore and Papua New Guinea respectively. These letters may specify
the conditions that the project applicant should meet in designing the
proposed mitigation activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the proposed mitigation activity concept is not accepted, the project
applicant will be informed, along with any reasons for the non-acceptance
(if relevant).</p>

<p>Singapore and Papua New Guinea may request for the submission of other
relevant documents not listed above to aid their assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LOS will have an assurance period of 1 year.&nbsp; After the assurance
period, Singapore reserves the right to withdraw the LOS if there are changes
to Singapore’s environmental integrity (EI) EI requirements that affect
the project. Changes in EI requirements will be published in Papua New
Guinea’s Eligibility List section in this website.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><em>Stage B – Design of the proposed mitigation activity</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>The project applicant submits the completed <u>Project Design Document (PDD) Submission Template</u> to
Joint Committee for assessment by Singapore and Papua New Guinea, which
will be based on the conditions and requirements in the Implementation
Agreement, Letter of Support (LOS) and Letter of Intent (LOI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After assessment, the Joint Committee will inform the project applicant
of the PDD submission outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the PDD Submission is accepted, Papua New Guinea will issue letter
of recommendation and Singapore will reaffirm the earlier issued Letter
of Support via an email to the Joint Committee, which will be forwarded
to the project applicant. The PDD submission is accepted when:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There is no change in EI requirement that may affect the project; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a change in EI requirement after the issuance of the Letter of
Support, but the project applicant submits the PDD within the 1-year assurance
period</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>If the PDD Submission is rejected because the project design is not feasible
or acceptable, the project applicant will be advised on how to revise their
project design (if relevant).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stage C – Authorisation of the proposed mitigation activity</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>The project applicant submits an authorisation application and the validation
report of the proposed mitigation activity to the Joint Committee. Please
note that the submission should be made within the validity period of the
LOS. After the validity period, NEA reserves the right to withdraw the
LOS if there are changes to Singapore’s environmental integrity (EI) requirements
that affect the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Joint Committee will assess the proposed activity and inform the project
applicant of the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the proposed mitigation activity is authorised, the Joint Committee
will:</p>
<p>1) forward the letters of authorisation issued by Singapore and Papua
New Guinea respectively;</p>
<p>2) enter the mitigation activity into the register; and</p>
<p>3) submit the initial report prepared jointly by Singapore and Papua New
Guinea to the UNFCCC Secretariat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the initial report has been accepted by the UNFCCC Secretariat,
the Joint Committee will issue a Joint Statement of Authorisation to the
project applicant, and publish the Joint Statement of Authorisation. The
Joint Statements of Authorisation issued can be found at this &lt;link&gt;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a Joint Statement of Authorisation has been issued, the project
“applicant” becomes a project “participant”. Project participants may then <strong>register</strong> their
mitigation activity with the approved International Offset Programme stated
in the letters of authorisation and <strong>inform </strong>the Joint Committee
of their registration. They may then begin to implement their project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the proposed activity is not authorised, the project applicant will
be advised by the Joint Committee on how to revise their project authorisation
application (if relevant).</p>

<p><em>Stage D – ITMO Issuance Authorisation</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Project Participant submits an ITMO issuance application to Singapore
and Papua New Guinea's Joint Committee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Joint Committee sends the application to Singapore and Papua New Guinea
separately to determine if the ITMO issuance meets their national requirements.
The Joint Committee will inform the project participant of the outcome
after assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the ITMOs are authorised for issuance, Papua New Guinea will issue
a Letter of Positive Examination and list the ITMOs in its national registry.
Corresponding adjustments will also be made, in accordance with Article
6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the ITMOs are not authorised for issuance, the applicant will be advised
on how to revise their ITMO issuance application (if relevant).</p>
