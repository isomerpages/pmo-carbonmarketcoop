Singapore has been actively engaging likeminded countries on carbon credits collaboration
aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This bilateral cooperative approach would
enable us to achieve emissions targets set out in our NDCs, while promoting sustainable
development and environmental integrity. It will also be underpinned by a legally binding
framework, known as an Implementation Agreement, signed between Singapore and host
countries.

**Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**

The MOU signals Singapore’s and host countries’ intent to collaborate on carbon markets,
aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Under the MOU, we will work towards a legally
binding Implementation Agreement and identify potential Article 6-compliant mitigation
activities which can support our achievement of respective NDCs.
Currently, Singapore has signed MOUs with the following countries:
