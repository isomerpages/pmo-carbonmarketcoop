Singapore seeks to set up bilateral carbon markets collaboration with host countries that are aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This bilateral cooperative approach would allow us to jointly achieve emissions targets set out in our NDCs, while promoting sustainable development and environmental integrity. It will also be underpinned by a legally binding framework, known as an Implementation Agreement, signed between Singapore and host countries.

Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

The MOU signals Singapore’s and host countries’ intent to collaborate on carbon markets, aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Under the MOU, we will work towards a legally binding Implementation Agreement. We will also work together to identify potential Article 6-compliant mitigation activities which can support our achievement of respective NDCs.

Currently, Singapore has signed MOUs with the following countries:

Implementation Agreement

The Implementation Agreement (IA) is a legal document that ~will~ sets out the bilateral framework for the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits (i.e. mitigation outcomes). The framework will cover processes such as project authorisation, reporting requirements, and corresponding adjustments. Private sector players can then leverage this framework to develop carbon credit projects that issue ITMOs.

The IA framework will adhere to existing national frameworks of Singapore and host countries in order to bolster environmental integrity, contribute to climate action, and ensure that the projects are mutually beneficial.

Other key benefits of this bilateral cooperative approach include:

* **Leverages existing carbon markets mechanisms** – To operationalise the collaboration quickly, high-integrity carbon crediting methodologies from credible offset programmes (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard, ART-TREES, America Carbon Registry, Global Carbon Council) will be used instead of setting up bilateral standards and methodologies.

*  **Authorised for all uses** – All correspondingly adjusted carbon credits will be authorised for all uses, including all countries’ NDC achievement and companies’ voluntary uses. This will facilitate the flow of carbon finances from a wider pool of demand to scale up climate action and ambition, while facilitating the growth of high-integrity carbon markets.

* **Contributes to adaptation actions** – Article 6 is designed to increase countries’ ambitions for both mitigation and adaptation actions. In lieu with the Article 6 rulebook, Singapore has decided to contribute resources towards climate adaptation through bilateral cooperation. As such, all projects authorised under Singapore’s Implementation Agreements will have to contribute 5% of their share of proceeds to the host countries’ adaptation needs and/or their Adaptation Fund.
