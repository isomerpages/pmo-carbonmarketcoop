##### Benefits of carbon trading
1. Carbon markets help to channel financial resources to support emissions reduction or removal activities globally, which would otherwise not be implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives.
2. This accelerates climate action and advances global climate ambition, by unlocking cost-effective mitgation activities to realise the Paris Agreement goal.
3. Carbon credits also provides various co-benefits to local communities where the projects are hosted, such as sustainable development through the creation of green jobs, sustainable energy, environmental and biodiversity protection, and climate adaptation and resilience.
