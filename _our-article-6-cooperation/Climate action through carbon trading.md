##### Cooperative mechanism under the Paris Agreement

Under the Paris Agreement, all countries must communicate their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and set climate targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s climate goal.

**Article 6** of the Paris Agreement allows countries to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their NDCs. This development opened the door to higher ambition in climate
mitigation and adaptation actions, while promoting sustainable development and environmental integrity. NDCs can be pursued through a market-based mechanism (Article 6.2, Article 6.4) and a non-market-based mechanism (Article 6.8). Singapore’s Minister of Sustainability and the Environment co-facilitated the conclusion of the Article 6 rulebook at COP-26 in December 2021.

**Article 6.2 provides the decentralised framework for bilateral or plurilateral cooperation between countries, through market-based mechanism of carbontrading**. Countries will trade Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) on a voluntary basis to jointly achieve their NDCs. Corresponding adjustments will be made to ensure no double counting of emissions reductions and removals by countries.

##### Additional requirement for Article 6-compliant carbon credits – Corresponding adjustments

According to the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, only **correspondingly adjusted carbon credits** can be used for a countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other international mitigation purposes, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). These correspondingly adjusted carbon credits are also referred to as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). With carbon credits correspondingly adjusted, it ensures no double counting as the carbon credits are only counted once towards an international mitigation obligation.

**Corresponding adjustments** refers to the transfer of underlying emissions reductions across countries’ greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. For example, when Country X buys 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e of carbon credits from Country Y, Country Y has to add 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e to its GHG inventory while Country
X will reduce 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in its GHG inventory.
