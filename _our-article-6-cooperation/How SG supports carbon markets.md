<h3><strong>Collaborating with other countries to support our climate ambition</strong></h3>
<p>As Singapore decarbonises our economy, we recognise our limited ability
to deploy renewable energy is limited given our constraints as a small
island city state that is densely populated. Effective international cooperation
through carbon markets, aligned with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement,
can thus help us achieve our climate targets.</p>
<p>One such means of international cooperation is carbon trading, aligned
with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>International cooperation aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
can raise global climate ambition and help countries that are alternative
energy disadvantaged (such as Singapore) to achieve their target through
the transfer of mitigation outcomes between countries. To unlock the potential
of Article 6, bilateral agreements between countries must be in place to
govern and facilitate the use of Article 6 compliant carbon credits to
offset the NDC of a country.</p>
<p>Singapore is pursuing cooperation with other countries under Article 6.2
of the Paris Agreement to enable the transfer of international mitigation
outcomes to Singapore. More details can be found in this <a href="https://carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/our-article-6-cooperation/singapores-art-6-cooperations/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>From <strong>2024 onwards</strong>, taxable facilities in Singapore will
be allowed to use high quality international carbon credits to offset up
to 5% of their taxable emissions, under Singaporeâ€™s carbon tax system.</p>
<h3><strong>Building a Vibrant Carbon Services Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore aspires to develop into a carbon services and trading hub by
tapping on its thriving ecosystem and locality in Southeast Asia, one of
the largest carbon credit sources. Based on a <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/singapore-is-well-positioned-to-become-a-carbon-services-and-trading-hub-for-southeast-asia-and-the-asia-pacific.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> commissioned
by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG),
it is estimated that this could create a projected gross value added (GVA)
of US$1.8-5.6 billion.</p>
<p>Setting up bilateral cooperation mechanisms with host countries will unlock
more green growth opportunities for our carbon services and trading ecosystem
beyond Southeast Asia. These opportunities include carbon credit project
financing and development, sustainable financing product structuring, and
market intermediaries.</p>
