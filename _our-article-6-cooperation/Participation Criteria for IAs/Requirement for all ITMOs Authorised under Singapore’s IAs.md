<h4><strong>Requirement for all Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) Authorised under Singapore’s Implementation Agreements (“IAs”) to be first either sold or transferred to Eligible Entities bona fide</strong></h4>
<p>To grow Singapore as a carbon services and trading hub, we require all
ITMOs* authorised under Singapore’s IAs to be first either sold or transferred
to an Eligible Entity bona fide (“Qualifying Sale or Transfer”).</p>
<p>An Eligible Entity refers to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>an entity that:</p>
<p>(a) is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise registered
in Singapore, and is a tax resident of Singapore;</p>
<p>(b) is carrying on a trade or business in Singapore^; and</p>
<p>(c) has at least 3 local employees, excluding company directors, who are
Singapore citizens or Singapore permanent residents and who and whose employer
make CPF contributions); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Singapore Government (including entities appointed by the Singapore
Government to act on its behalf to receive ITMOs) and statutory boards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>* Excluding OMGE (Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions) and SOP (Share of Proceeds) units. For avoidance of doubt, OMGE and SOP units are not required to be sold or transferred to an Eligible Entity.</em>
</p>
<p><em>^ An entity is carrying on a trade or business in Singapore if it has gains or profits accruing in or derived from Singapore, or received in Singapore from outside Singapore, upon which income tax is payable pursuant to section 10(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act.</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>Definition of Qualifying Sale or Transfer of ITMOs to an Eligible Entity</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Where the project developer</strong> (referred to in the IA process
as “Project Applicant” or Project Participant”, depending on the stage
of the process) <strong>is an Eligible Entity</strong>, the Qualifying Sale
or Transfer refers to the issuance of ITMOs by the carbon standard registry
(e.g. Verra, Gold Standard), into the project developer’s registry account.</p>
<p><strong>Where the project developer is <u>not</u> an Eligible Entity</strong>,
the Qualifying Sale or Transfer is the first transfer of ITMOs out of the
project developer’s registry account, after the ITMOs have been issued
by the carbon standard registry to the project developer. This Qualifying
Sale or Transfer must be to an Eligible Entity.</p>
<h4><strong>Action Needed</strong></h4>
<p>All project developers must take the following actions to comply with
Singapore’s requirements (ref. Table 1).</p>

<h4><strong>Request for Supporting Evidence</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project developers may also be required to provide evidence that ITMOs
previously authorised under Singapore’s IAs have either been sold or transferred
to Eligible Entities. The Singapore Government will request such evidence
when the project developers have previously successfully applied for corresponding
adjustments of ITMOs under one of Singapore’s IAs and are applying for
the authorisation of additional ITMOs. The Singapore Government may also
request the evidence at any time up to 3 years from the date of the relevant
ITMOs’ authorisation. The evidence requested may include:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) Registry transaction records showing that past ITMOs authorised under
the IA were transferred to the Eligible Entities;</p>
<p>(b) Sales receipt showing the sale of past ITMOs authorised under the
IA to Eligible Entities (receipt must clearly indicate the relevant mitigation
activity, volumes of ITMOs transacted, and the&nbsp; names of both the
project developer and Buyer); and</p>
<p>(c) Other documents that show clearly show ownership transfer of past
ITMOs authorised under the IA to Eligible Entities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Singapore Government may directly contact the Eligible Entities to
provide supporting evidence of their eligibility, including:</p>
<p>(a) Last 24 months of audited financial statements; and</p>
<p>(b) Last 24 months of employee records.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The Singapore Government may, on a case-by-case basis and as appropriate, consider other documents submitted by the project developers as evidence for the fulfilment of the above requirements.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The Singapore Government may also, on a case-by-case basis and as appropriate, waive the requirement for ITMOs authorised under Singapore’s IAs to be first sold or transferred to an Eligible Entity. For instance, the Singapore Government may allow the ITMOs to be first sold or transferred to an entity that does not carry out trade or business in Singapore in a specific case, if it assesses that the sale or transfer will bring benefits to Singapore. Project developers seeking waiver of the requirement are to write to</em>  <em><a href="mailto:Climate_Cooperation@pmo.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Climate_Cooperation@pmo.gov.sg</a></em>  <em>prior to the intended sale or transfer.</em>
