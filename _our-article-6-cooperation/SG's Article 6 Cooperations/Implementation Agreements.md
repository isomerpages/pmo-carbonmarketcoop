<h3>Implementation Agreement</h3>
<p>The Implementation Agreement (IA) sets out the bilateral framework for
the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits (i.e.
mitigation outcomes) between host countries and Singapore. The framework
will cover processes such as project authorisation, reporting requirements,
and corresponding adjustments. Private sector players can then leverage
this framework to develop carbon credit projects that issue ITMOs.</p>
<p>The IA framework will adhere to existing national frameworks of Singapore
and host countries in order to bolster environmental integrity, contribute
to climate action, and ensure that the projects are mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Other key benefits of this bilateral cooperative approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverages existing carbon markets mechanisms</strong> – To operationalise
the collaboration quickly, high-integrity carbon crediting methodologies
from credible offset programmes (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard, ART-TREES,
America Carbon Registry, Global Carbon Council) will be used instead of
setting up bilateral standards and methodologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authorised for all uses</strong> – All correspondingly adjusted
carbon credits will be authorised for all uses, including countries’ NDC
achievement and companies’ voluntary uses. This will facilitate the flow
of carbon finances from a wider pool of demand to scale up climate action
and ambition, while fostering the growth of high-integrity carbon markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contributes to adaptation actions</strong> – Article 6 is designed
to increase countries’ ambitions for both mitigation and adaptation actions.
In lieu of the Article 6 rulebook, Singapore has decided to contribute
resources towards climate adaptation through bilateral cooperation. As
such, all projects authorised under Singapore’s Implementation Agreements
will have to contribute 5% of their share of proceeds or equivalent to
the host countries’ adaptation needs and/or their Adaptation Fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contributes to Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions (OMGE)</strong> –
Singapore requires all projects authorised under Singapore's Implementation
Agreements to cancel 2% of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits to deliver
OMGE, which is strongly encouraged under Article 6 rules. Cancellation
ensures that these carbon credits will not be used towards the country's
NDC, compliance requirements or voluntary targets, thereby serving the
sole purpose of emissions reduction.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Ghana. More information can be found <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/implementation-agreements/overall-ias/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
