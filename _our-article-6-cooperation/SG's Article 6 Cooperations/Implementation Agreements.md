### Implementation Agreement

The Implementation Agreement (IA) sets out the bilateral framework for the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits (i.e. mitigation outcomes) between host countries and Singapore. The framework will cover processes such as project authorisation, reporting requirements, and corresponding adjustments. Private sector players can then leverage this framework to develop carbon credit projects that issue ITMOs.

The IA framework will adhere to existing national frameworks of Singapore and host countries in order to bolster environmental integrity, contribute to climate action, and ensure that the projects are mutually beneficial.

Other key benefits of this bilateral cooperative approach include:

* **Leverages existing carbon markets mechanisms** – To operationalise the collaboration
quickly, high-integrity carbon crediting methodologies from credible offset
programmes (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard, ART-TREES, America Carbon Registry, Global
Carbon Council) will be used instead of setting up bilateral standards and
methodologies.

* **Authorised for all uses** – All correspondingly adjusted carbon credits will be authorised
for all uses, including countries’ NDC achievement and companies’ voluntary uses. This
will facilitate the flow of carbon finances from a wider pool of demand to scale up
climate action and ambition, while fostering the growth of high-integrity carbon
markets.

* **Contributes to adaptation actions** – Article 6 is designed to increase countries’
ambitions for both mitigation and adaptation actions. In lieu of the Article 6 rulebook,
Singapore has decided to contribute resources towards climate adaptation through
bilateral cooperation. As such, all projects authorised under Singapore’s
Implementation Agreements will have to contribute 5% of their share of proceeds or
equivalent to the host countries’ adaptation needs and/or their Adaptation Fund.

* **Contributes to Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions (OMGE)** – Singapore requires all projects authorised under Singapore's Implementation Agreements to cancel 2% of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits to deliver OMGE, which is strongly encouraged under Article 6 rules. Cancellation ensures that these carbon credits will not be used towards the country's NDC, compliance requirements or voluntary targets, thereby serving the sole purpose of emissions reduction.
