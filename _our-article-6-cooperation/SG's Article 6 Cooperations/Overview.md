## Overview

Singapore has been actively engaging likeminded countries on carbon credits collaboration
aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This bilateral cooperative approach would
enable us to achieve emissions targets set out in our NDCs, while promoting sustainable
development and environmental integrity. It will also be underpinned by a legally binding
framework, known as an Implementation Agreement, signed between Singapore and host
countries.
