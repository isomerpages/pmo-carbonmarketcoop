description: Why and how Singapore participates in and supports carbon trading
---
**Carbon trading allows Singapore to collaborate with other countries towards achievement of climate targets.**

Given Singapore’s geographical constraints as a small island-city-state, our access to alternative
sources of energy is limited, placing us in a disadvantaged position. Effective international
cooperation can help us achieve our climate targets. One such means of international cooperation
is carbon trading, aligned with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Bilateral agreements between
countries (Implementation Agreements) need to be in place to facilitate such use of carbon
credits. Singapore is committed to using high-integrity carbon credits. These carbon credits have the potential to help host countries go above and beyond their unconditional Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs), or climate commitments that the host countries intend to
achieve without external support. Beyond the carbon crediting period, the mitigation outcomes
generated could be accrued to the host countries’ for future NDCs.
From 2024, taxable facilities in Singapore will be allowed to use high quality international carbon
credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions, under Singapore’s carbon tax system.
In support of global climate ambition, Singapore’s bilateral agreements will require carbon credit
developers to make a monetary contribution equivalent to 5% the share of proceeds (SOP) of the
Article 6-authorised carbon credits generated under our Implementation Agreements towards the
host countries’ adaptation actions and/or UNFCCC Adaptation Fund.
Article 6 transactions through Singapore will also support an overall mitigation of global emissions
(OMGE). 2% of Article 6-authorised carbon credits are required to be cancelled at issuance, tereby preventing these credits from entering the market and contributing to an overall itigation of global emissions.

**Carbon markets present Singapore with emerging green growth opportunities**

Singapore aspires to develop into a carbon services and trading hub by tapping on its thriving
ecosystem and proximity to Southeast Asia, one of the largest carbon credit sources. Based on a [study](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/singapore-is-well-positioned-to-become-a-carbon-services-and-trading-hub-for-southeast-asia-and-the-asia-pacific.html) commissioned by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG),
it is estimated that this could create a projected gross value added (GVA) of US$1.8-5.6 billion.

Setting up bilateral cooperation mechanisms with host countries will unlock more green growth
opportunities for our carbon services and trading ecosystem beyond Southeast Asia. These
opportunities include carbon credit project financing and development, sustainable financing
product structuring, and market intermediaries.
