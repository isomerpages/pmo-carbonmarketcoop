description: Why and how Singapore participates in and supports carbon trading
---
**Carbon trading allows Singapore to collaborate with other countries towards achievement of climate targets.**

Given Singapore’s geographical constraints as a small island-city-state, our access to alternative sources of energy is limited, placing us in a disadvantaged position. Effective international cooperation can help us achieve our climate targets. 

One such means of international cooperation is carbon trading, aligned with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Bilateral agreements between countries (Implementation Agreements) need to be in place to facilitate such use of carbon credits. Singapore is committed to using high-integrity carbon credits. These carbon credits have the potential to help host countries go above and beyond their unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or climate commitments that the host countries intend to achieve without external support. 

From **2024**, taxable facilities in Singapore will be allowed to use high quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions, under Singapore’s carbon tax system. 

**Carbon markets present Singapore with emerging green growth opportunities**

Singapore aspires to develop into a carbon services and trading hub by tapping on its thriving
ecosystem and locality in Southeast Asia, one of the largest carbon credit sources. Based on a [study](https:/www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/singapore-is-well-positioned-to-become-a-carbon-services-and-trading-hub-for-southeast-asia-and-the-asia-pacific.html) commissioned by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG),
it is estimated that this could create a projected gross value added (GVA) of US$1.8-5.6 billion.

Setting up bilateral cooperation mechanisms with host countries will unlock more green growth
opportunities for our carbon services and trading ecosystem beyond Southeast Asia. These
opportunities include carbon credit project financing and development, sustainable financing
product structuring, and market intermediaries.
