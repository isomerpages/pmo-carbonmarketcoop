<p><em>Carbon credits,</em> also known as <em>carbon offsets,</em> refer to
carbon emissions reductions, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent
(tCO2e). Carbon credits can be generated through projects which take in
carbon from the atmosphere (e.g. reforestation), or reduce the amount of
carbon released into the atmosphere (e.g. renewable energy projects). <em>Carbon markets</em> enable
the buying, selling, transfer and exchange of carbon credits.</p>

<p>To ensure these carbon credits can truly advance global climate action
and ambition, they need to meet a set of environmental integrity principles.</p>
