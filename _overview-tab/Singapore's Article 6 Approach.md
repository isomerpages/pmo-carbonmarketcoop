<h4><strong>Collaborating with other countries to support our climate ambition</strong></h4>
<p>As Singapore decarbonises our economy, we recognise our ability to deploy
renewable energy is limited given our constraints as a small island city
state that is densely populated. Effective international cooperation through
carbon markets can thus help us achieve our climate targets.</p>
<p>One such means of international cooperation is carbon trading, aligned
with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>International cooperation aligned with the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
can raise global climate ambition and help countries that are alternative
energy disadvantaged (such as Singapore) to achieve their targets through
the transfer of mitigation outcomes between countries. To unlock the potential
of Article 6, bilateral agreements between countries will need to be in
place to govern and facilitate the use of Article 6-compliant carbon credits
to offset the NDC of a country.</p>
<p>Singapore is pursuing cooperation with other countries under Article 6.2
of the Paris Agreement to enable the transfer of international mitigation
outcomes to Singapore.&nbsp;More details can be found in this <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/introduction/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2024, under Singaporeâ€™s International Carbon Credit framework, taxable
facilities in Singapore are allowed to use eligible international carbon
credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.</p>
<h4><strong>Building a Vibrant Carbon Services Ecosystem</strong></h4>
<p>Singapore aspires to be a carbon services and trading hub by tapping on
its thriving ecosystem and locality in Southeast Asia, one of the largest
carbon credit sources. Based on a study commissioned by the Economic Development
Board and Enterprise Singapore, it is estimated that this could create
a projected gross value added (GVA) of US$1.8-5.6 billion.</p>
<p>Setting up bilateral cooperation mechanisms with host countries will unlock
more green growth opportunities for our carbon services and trading ecosystem
beyond Southeast Asia.&nbsp; These opportunities include carbon credit
project financing and development, sustainable financing product structuring,
and market intermediaries.</p>
