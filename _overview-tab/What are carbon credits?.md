<h4><strong>Carbon credits, or carbon offsets, refer to carbon emissions reductions or removals, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). </strong></h4>
<p>Carbon credits can be generated through projects which take in carbon
(e.g. reforestation), or reduce the amount of carbon released into the
atmosphere (e.g. renewable energy projects).</p>
<p>There are four general stages of a carbon credit’s lifecycle.</p>

<h4><strong>Carbon credits support climate action by unlocking much-needed capital for mitigation projects which otherwise would not be implemented.</strong></h4>
<p>Carbon markets accelerate climate action by unlocking capital for emission
reduction or removal projects globally, which would otherwise not be implemented.
Carbon credits can also advance sustainable development and provide co-benefits
to local communities.</p>
<p>Examples of carbon projects and co-benefits.</p>

<h4><strong>Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, countries can trade Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) to achieve their climate targets</strong></h4>
<p>Article 6 of the Paris Agreement sets out the framework for countries
to voluntarily cooperate to achieve their climate targets, otherwise known
as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p>
<p>Through enabling the trading of Internationally Transferred Mitigation
Outcomes (ITMOs), host countries could potentially go above and beyond
their unconditional NDCs, which are commitments that host countries intend
to achieve without external support.</p>
<p>For ITMOs to be used towards the buyer country’s NDC, the host country
would need to apply Corresponding Adjustments (CAs) to ensure no double
counting of emission reductions and removals.</p>
<p>For example, when Country X buys 1MtCO<sub>2</sub>e of carbon credits
from Country Y, Country Y has to add 1MtCO<sub>2</sub>e to its GHG inventory
while Country X will reduce 1MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in its GHG inventory.</p>
