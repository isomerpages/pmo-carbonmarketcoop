<h4><strong>Requirement for all Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) Authorised under Singapore’s Implementation Agreements (“IAs”) to be first either sold or transferred to Eligible Entities bona fide</strong></h4>
<p>To grow Singapore's carbon services and trading ecosystem, we require
all ITMOs* authorised under Singapore’s IAs to be first either sold or
transferred to an Eligible Entity bona fide (“Qualifying Sale or Transfer”).</p>
<p>An Eligible Entity refers to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Singapore-based companies that:</p>
<p>(a) is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise registered
in Singapore, and is a tax resident of Singapore;</p>
<p>(b) is carrying on a trade or business in Singapore^; and</p>
<p>(c) has at least 3 local employees, excluding company directors, who are
Singapore citizens or Singapore permanent residents and who and whose employer
make CPF contributions); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Singapore Government (including entities appointed by the Singapore
Government to act on its behalf to receive ITMOs) and Statutory Boards.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>* Excluding OMGE (Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions) and SOP (Share
of Proceeds) units. For avoidance of doubt, OMGE and SOP units are not
required to be sold or transferred to an Eligible Entity.</p>
<p>^ An entity is carrying on a trade or business in Singapore if it has
gains or profits accruing in or derived from Singapore, or received in
Singapore from outside Singapore, upon which income tax is payable pursuant
to section 10(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Qualifying Sale or Transfer of ITMOs to an Eligible Entity</strong>
</p>
<p>Where the project developer&nbsp;(referred to in the IA process as “Project
Applicant” or Project Participant”, depending on the stage of the process)&nbsp;is
an Eligible Entity, the Qualifying Sale or Transfer refers to the issuance
of ITMOs by the carbon standard registry (e.g. Verra, Gold Standard), into
the project developer’s registry account.</p>
<p>Where the project developer is&nbsp;not&nbsp;an Eligible Entity, the Qualifying
Sale or Transfer is the first transfer of ITMOs out of the project developer’s
registry account, after the ITMOs have been issued by the carbon standard
registry to the project developer. This Qualifying Sale or Transfer must
be to an Eligible Entity.</p>
<p><strong>Action Needed</strong>
</p>
<p>All project developers must take the following actions to comply with
Singapore’s requirements under the Implementation Agreement (IA) (ref.
Table 1). The specific stage of the IA authorisation process where each
document is to be submitted may differ across IAs.</p>
