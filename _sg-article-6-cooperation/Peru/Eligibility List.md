<p>The above list of carbon crediting programmes and methodologies meet the
eligibility criteria and domestic laws, regulations and administrative
frameworks of both Ghana and Singapore.&nbsp;
<br>Though eligible, the applicability of these methodologies may be further
assessed by both Ghana and Singapore when project applications are submitted.
Singapore and / or Peru reserves the right to refuse authorisation of a
mitigation activity. The refusal for authorisation may be due to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The methodology is not aligned with domestic laws, regulations and administrative
frameworks of respective countries, when the project application is submitted.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology has been suspended or placed under formal review by the
relevant carbon crediting programme, when the project application is submitted.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology is not the latest version.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

methodologies can be found <a href="https://carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/additional-environmental-integrity-safeguards/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
