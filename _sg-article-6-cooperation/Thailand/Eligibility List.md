<p>The above list of carbon crediting programmes and methodologies meet the
eligibility criteria and domestic laws, regulations and administrative
frameworks of both Thailand and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though eligible, the applicability of these methodologies may be further
assessed by both Thailand and Singapore when project applications are submitted.
Projects utilising the methodologies marked with an asterisk are assessed
on a case-by-case basis. Singapore and / or Thailand reserves the right
to refuse authorisation of a mitigation activity.</p>
<p>The refusal for authorisation may be due to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The methodology is not aligned with domestic laws, regulations and administrative
frameworks of respective countries, when the project application is submitted.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology has been suspended or placed under formal review by the
relevant carbon crediting programme, when the project application is submitted.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology is not the latest version.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
