_Carbon credits,_ also known as _carbon offsets,_ refer to carbon emissions reductions, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Carbon credits can be generated through projects which take in carbon from the atmosphere (e.g. reforestation), or reduce the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere (e.g. renewable energy projects). *Carbon trading* is a market-based mechanism which enables the buying, selling, transfer, and exchange of carbon credits. *Illustrative process of carbon credits generation and carbon trading:*

To ensure these carbon credits can truly advance global climate action and ambition, they need to meet a set of environmental integrity principles, which are explained in the graphic below.

##### Benefits of carbon trading
1. Carbon trading supports the implementation of emissions reduction and removal activities which are additional. This means that these mitigation efforts otherwise would not have happened without the revenue generated from carbon trading.
2. Carbon trading provides significant green growth opportunities in the private sector.
3. Carbon trading allows the advancement and realisation of climate ambitions aligned to Paris Agreement goal more cost effectively.

Implementing carbon credit projects also provides co-benefits and advances sustainable development goals of the Host countries. For instance:

Participating in carbon trading allows for higher ambition in mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity.
