### The Paris Agreement <br>

**Nationally Determined Contributions** - Under the Paris Agreement, all countries have nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are countries’ climate ambitions. There are two types:

* Conditional NDCs: achievement is contingent on international support and circumstances being in the country’s favor.
* Unconditional NDCs: achievement must be without international aid and independent of circumstances.

**Article 6** of the Paris Agreement allows parties to use Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (“ITMOs”) on a voluntary basis to meet nationally determined contributions. ITMOs are units of mitigation outcomes which use a carbon dioxide equivalent metric under Article 6. Our Minister of Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, co-facilitated the Article 6 rulebook.

Art 6.2 outlines the decentralized mechanism of trading ITMOs through bilateral cooperation. This underpins carbon trading post 2020 and leverages pre-existing standards including the ICAO CORSIA Emissions Unit eligibility criteria. 

Article 6 generally aims to:
1) Promote emissions mitigation while fostering sustainable development,
2) Incentivise emissions mitigations across the public and private sector,
3) Help the participating countries fulfill their NDCs, and
4) Deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions.


Other key features of article 6 include:
* Art 6.5, prohibiting double counting, or corresponding adjustments between countries.
* Art 6.6, asking that a share of proceeds from the projects developed should be used to cover administrative costs of developing countries.
* Art 6.9, requiring countries to have a bilateral framework of accounting for carbon credits.
