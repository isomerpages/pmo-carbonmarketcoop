The Paris Agreement <br>

**Nationally Determined Contributions** - Under the Paris Agreement, all countries have nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are countries’ climate ambitions. There are two types:

* Conditional NDCs: achievement is contingent on international support and circumstances being in the country’s favor.
* Unconditional NDCs: achievement must be without international aid and independent of circumstances.

**Article 6** of the Paris Agreement allows parties to use Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (“ITMOs”) on a voluntary basis to meet nationally determined contributions. ITMOs are units of mitigation outcomes which use a carbon dioxide equivalent metric under Article 6. Our Minister of Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, co-facilitated the Article 6 rulebook.
