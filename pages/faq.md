### **FAQ**

>1.  What if I submit my application to the wrong link?

Please resubmit to the correct submission portal. Members comprising the Joint Committee may differ between each country.

>2. Do I need to apply to the Gold Standard or Verra organizations separately?

If you are pioneering the use of a new methodology, then yes. Please refer to each of their websites for the methodology application process and requirements. They will need to assess whether your methodology meets the eligibility criteria necessary to ensure the environmental integrity of the carbon offset.

If, however, you are using a pre-approved methodology, please refer to the steps outlined on our website.

>3. What happens if I run into double counting issues with my carbon credits?

You may seek to resolve issues regarding the double counting of carbon credits (also known as corresponding adjustments) by emailing or writing to the relevant Ghanian agency. The Ghanian agency should respond within 30 days to propose a plan to address your problem.

If disputes are not resolved in 180 days (roughly 6 months), the Joint Committee will step in to handle the issue.

Aside from the above means, you may still choose to go through other remedies or routes of dispute resolution.

>4. Is it possible to submit the same application to multiple countries?

The applicable eligibility criteria differ under each country’s Implementation Agreements. Please check the tabs under the Implementation agreement to ensure that you meet the standards of the host country that you are applying to.
